Raptoreum Encyclopedia (RTM-Wiki)

Welcome to the official documentation and encyclopedia for the Raptoreum (RTM) network.

**Note** 
The original graphic Learn page can be found at https://learn.raptoreum.com.
This Github repository serves as an interface.
All data stored here is automatically transferred to the Learn page.
The goal is for the Github community to view the Learn page as a “Raptoreum WIKI” and to help build the page collaboratively via issues and branches.

The automatic transfer of data from Github to the Learnpage can take up to 5 minutes after a branch is created.
