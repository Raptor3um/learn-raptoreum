### Why Raptoreum?

Raptoreum is a secure, asset-oriented Proof-of-Work blockchain powered by the custom **GhostRider** algorithm. Built from the ground up to be ASIC- and FPGA-resistant, it enables everyday users to participate in network security using standard CPU hardware — no specialized equipment required.

- **GhostRider Algorithm:** A custom PoW algorithm designed specifically for Raptoreum to prevent ASIC/FPGA dominance and keep mining accessible to everyone.
- **Custom Assets:** Create, manage, and transfer both fungible and non-fungible assets (NFAs) directly on-chain — no programming skills required. Each asset has a unique name, and only one instance of that name can ever exist on the blockchain.
- **Smartnodes:** A collateralized second-layer network that enables advanced features such as InstantSend and PrivateSend — while also forming the backbone of Raptoreum's security model.
- **51% Attack Protection:** Active since March 4, 2021, LLMQ-based ChainLocks ensure that even if an attacker gains more than 51% of the network's hash power, they can never reorganize the chain by more than one block. This makes Raptoreum one of the most attack-resistant PoW blockchains available.
- **Fair Launch:** No ICO, no pre-mine — Raptoreum launched on February 26, 2021, with a community-driven approach and a custom emission schedule designed to avoid hyperinflation.
