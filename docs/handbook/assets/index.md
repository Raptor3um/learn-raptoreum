Introduction to Raptoreum Assets

## Overview of Raptoreum Assets

Raptoreum has implemented a unique, protocol-level asset system that sets it apart from the majority of other NFT and FT solutions, such as those found on Ethereum or Solana. This integration within the Raptoreumcore wallet allows users to create and manage Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Fungible Tokens (FTs) with just a few clicks, without the need for smart contracts or any coding expertise. This ease of use, combined with the advanced features and protections built into the Raptoreum network, makes it a compelling choice for individuals and businesses looking to leverage digital assets.


## Key Differences and Advantages of Raptoreum Assets

1. Protocol-Level Integration:

    Unlike many other blockchain platforms where NFTs and FTs require smart contracts or external tools for creation, Raptoreum assets are integrated at the protocol level. This integration means:
        
    - No Smart Contracts Required: Users can create assets without worrying about the complexities or risks associated with smart contracts.
    - Simplified Creation Process: The asset creation process is straightforward, requiring only a few clicks within the Raptoreumcore wallet.

2. Integrated IPFS Support:

    Raptoreum has taken a pioneering step by integrating IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) directly into the Raptoreumcore wallet. This feature allows users to attach files to their assets seamlessly, making it an industry-first solution. The benefits include:

    - Decentralized File Storage: IPFS ensures that files attached to assets are stored in a decentralized manner, enhancing security and redundancy.
    - Ease of Use: Attaching files to assets is as simple as the asset creation process, with no need for external services or tools.

3. Decentralization and Security:

    Raptoreum is designed to promote decentralization and security through several key features:

    - ASIC and FPGA Resistance: Raptoreum's mining algorithm discourages the centralization of mining power, which is a common issue on networks dominated by ASICs and FPGAs.
    - 51% Attack Protection via ChainLocks: Raptoreum has implemented ChainLocks, a feature that protects the network against 51% attacks, ensuring that the integrity of the blockchain remains intact.

4. Scalability and Future-Proofing:

    Raptoreum's current transaction throughput is around 50 Transactions Per Second (TPS), but the team is actively working on a scaling solution through transaction decoupling. This solution, which leverages a sidechain and the smartnode network, is expected to increase the network's capacity to approximately 450 TPS. Additionally:

    Dynamic Fee Adjustment: In the future, Raptoreum will be able to adjust network fees dynamically, preventing the network from suffering from high fees like those seen on Ethereum.

## Why Choose Raptoreum for Digital Assets?

1. Ease of Use:

    The simplicity of creating and managing assets on Raptoreum makes it accessible to a wide range of users, from individuals to businesses, without requiring technical expertise.

2. Decentralization:

    Raptoreum’s focus on decentralization ensures that power is not concentrated in the hands of a few, making the network more resilient and fair.

3. Security:

    With advanced protections like ASIC and FPGA resistance and 51% attack prevention, Raptoreum inspires confidence in the security of assets created on its network.

4. Scalability:

    The ongoing development of transaction decoupling and dynamic fee adjustment ensures that Raptoreum remains scalable and cost-effective as it grows, making it a future-proof choice for digital assets.

## Conclusion

Raptoreum’s innovative approach to digital assets, integrating asset creation directly into the protocol and enhancing it with decentralized storage via IPFS, positions it as a leading choice for anyone looking to create, manage, and secure digital assets. With its advanced security measures, commitment to decentralization, and ongoing scalability improvements, Raptoreum offers a robust, user-friendly platform that meets the needs of both individuals and businesses.
