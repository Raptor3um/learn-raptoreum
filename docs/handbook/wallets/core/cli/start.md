Config & Start

1. You can configure many settings in the raptoreum.conf file.

    Note: Some changes require a redindex of the core wallet after modifying the config.

2. Starting the Daemon

    Now you can start the synchronization process.
    ```bash
    ./raptoreumd
    ```

3. Check the current status and sync progress
    ```bash
    raptoreum-cli getblock
    ```

4. Use the commands from the help file
    ```bash
    ./raptoreum-cli help
    ```

Note: You can also see all commands here: [RPC Commands](../../../../dev/rpc/index.md)
