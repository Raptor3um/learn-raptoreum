## Intro To Mining Raptoreum
Raptoreum is a Proof of Work (POW) blockchain which uses the Ghostrider algorithm. 
Ghostrider was explicitly created for Raptoreum, and is designed to keep speciality hardware such as ASICs or FPGA off the Raptoreum network.


## How Does Mining Work?
Mining is like solving puzzles. 
Imagine you have a big box of jigsaw puzzles, and every time you put a puzzle together, you get a reward. 
In the world of Raptoreum and other POW (Proof of Work) cryptocurrencies, these puzzles are really hard math problems. When you solve one, you help keep the network secure and get some Raptoreum coins (RTM) as a reward.


## Proof of Work (PoW)
Raptoreum uses something called Proof of Work (PoW) to make mining work. Here’s a simple way to understand it:

- The Puzzle: Imagine everyone has the same really hard puzzle to solve.
- Solving the Puzzle: People use their computers to try and solve the puzzle as fast as they can. This takes a lot of computing power, kind of like how running takes a lot of energy.
- The Winner: The first person to solve the puzzle gets a reward. They get some Raptoreum coins and get to add a new block (a group of transactions) to the blockchain (a big digital ledger that keeps track of all the coins).

Ghostrider's technical details can be found on the [GhostRider Whitepaper](../papers/ghostwriter.md).

CPU mining is still the most efficient way to mine Raptoreum, but GPUs can also be used. GPU mining however, is not as efficient as CPU mining.

## Mining Software

- Raptorwings
- Wyvern CPU Miner
- XMRig CPU Miner
- XMRig CC CPU Miner
- WildRig GPU Miner


## ARM Mining
You can mine Raptoreum on ARM devices using Wyvern Miner, as well as XMRig. Both have to be compiled for ARM platforms, and work best on ARMv8. This is experimental and not officially supported. Mining on mobile phones is not advisable due to potential dangers involving lithium batteries and overheating.

 
## Raptoreum Mining Pools
You can see a list of Raptoreum mining pools on Mining Pool Stats.

Raptorhash may not show up on Mining Pool Stats. This pool allows you to mine other coins and be paid in RTM. This allows you to utilize other hardware such as ASIC, FPGA, and GPU and be paid in RTM.
